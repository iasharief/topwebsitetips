        <h4 class="description">Hello, and welcome to my webpage! Here, you can learn some of the best tips for coding your website from scratch!</h4>
        </div>
        
        
        <h3 class="Header">Basics of Web Development<br></h3>

        <ul class="Information">
            <h4>We use a type of programming language called HTML which stands for Hyper Text Markup Code. Many developers also use CSS to help color and style their websites, to make them look nice.</h4>
            
        	<li class="M-Fact">At the most basic, you put different words like html, head, body, etc. inside of two '< >' symbols, and text, links, and more go after that, with "<_/>" to close.
</li>
        	<li class="M-Fact">Headers can be used to make larger text, to start off your website and divide text into sections.
</li>
        	<li class="M-Fact">In angled brackets, if you type "p", follow it with text, then close it, you can type normal, small text, like this.
</li>
        	<li class="M-Fact">The "img" inside agled brackets can be followed by an image link after 'src="your_image_link_here"'. There is no closing tag for the img, and all of the information goes inside the lone tag.</li>
            <li class="M-Fact">Styling can be used to color, size, change font, and more, so your website doesn't have to be boring!</li>
            <li class="M-Fact">If you are a beginner trying to learn to code, I recommend checking out W3schools, with many lessons on all the aspects of learning HTML and CSS.</li>

        <ul class="Mars-List">
        	<h3 class="M-Fact">There are multiple types of ways to format your website, and in this video, I list some of the  best formats for your website, like the brochure, online store, and more! At least one of these five formats will fulfill your business's website needs.</h3>
        	
        
        <h3 class="Header">Flybys<br></h1>
        <iframe id="Flyby_Img"src='https://mars.nasa.gov/embed/6805/' width='50%'   scrolling='no' frameborder='0'></iframe>
        <ul class="Mars-List">
       
        	<h3 class="M-Fact">What is a Flyby? <br><br>A flyby is when a flying vehicle flies past a point, usually close to the surface of a planet or moon, like Mars.</h3>
        	<li class="M-Fact">Mariner 4 did the first flyby for mars in 1965. It flew 6000 miles from the surface and took 21 photos.
</li>
        	<li class="M-Fact">From the photos, there was no sign of life, only craters. This shows there wasn’t any life for billions of years.
</li>
        	<li class="M-Fact">There were 8 flyby attempts for mars in the 20th century, and 4 in the 21st by both Nasa and the Soviet Union.</li>
        	<li class="M-Fact">The plural of flyby is flybys instead of flybies, which breaks the English rules! </li>
        </ul>
         
        
      
		<h3 class="Header">Life on Mars</h3>	
		<p class="M-Fact">There may be life on Mars. Firstly, all living things need water to survive according to most scientists. Rovers and other discoverers have captured images of riverbeds that may have held water for living things to drink from. But, Mars doesn't trap heat like Earth does because of a very thin atmosphere. This means that the average temperature on Mars is a rough -63º C (-81.4º F), and therefore, any water would freeze instantly. In addition, as was said earlier, Mars's atmosphere is mostly made of carbon dioxide, so creatures like us cannot breathe. However, some plants and other organisms can both breathe carbon dioxide and survive very cold temperatures, so simple forms of life may be on Mars.</p>
