        <ul id="basics" class="Information">
            <h4>We use a type of programming language called HTML which stands for Hyper Text Markup Code. Many developers also use CSS to help color and style their websites, to make them look nice.</h4>
            
        	<li class="M-Fact">At the most basic, you put different words like html, head, body, etc. inside of two '< >' symbols, and text, links, and more go after that, with "<_/>" to close.
</li>
        	<li class="M-Fact">Headers can be used to make larger text, to start off your website and divide text into sections.
</li>
        	<li class="M-Fact">In angled brackets, if you type "p", follow it with text, then close it, you can type normal, small text, like this.
</li>
        	<li class="M-Fact">The "img" inside agled brackets can be followed by an image link after 'src="your_image_link_here"'. There is no closing tag for the img, and all of the information goes inside the lone tag.</li>
            <li class="M-Fact">Styling can be used to color, size, change font, and more, so your website doesn't have to be boring!</li>
            <li class="M-Fact">If you are a beginner trying to learn to code, I recommend checking out W3schools, with many lessons on all the aspects of learning HTML and CSS.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="Mars-List">
        	<h3 class="M-Fact">There are multiple types of ways to format your website, and in this video, I list some of the  best formats for your website, like the brochure, online store, and more! At least one of these five formats will fulfill your business's website needs.</h3>

        <ul class="Mars-List">
       
        	<h4 class="M-Fact"></h4>
        	<li class="M-Fact">There should be ads for larger websites, and it needs to be simple. There should be one to two ads on a page if that is one of your only sources of revenue. Otherwise, your webpage may become laggy and the viewer or customer will not have a great experience.
</li>
        	<li class="M-Fact">
However, you want to update very frequently and let your clients join websites and email signups. 
</li>
        	<li class="M-Fact">
There can even be popups, however, you don’t want your reader to get to overwhelmed with them, whether they are email signups, promotions, discounts, etc. </li>
        	<li class="M-Fact">
You should use strong word choice, with exquisite adjectives and make it fun and exciting for the reader. Add interactives so the reader/customer can get every detail about what your are trying to sell/tell.</li>
       
        <li class="M-Fact">

At least update a few times a month, so your readers aren’t left hanging for whatever you are trying to achieve. Write new articles on a diverse set of topics, or provide newer versions of your product.</li>

        <li class="M-Fact">
Not everyone is using a computer nowadays, so your website needs to be compatible with mobile devices so everyone can view it. 
</li>

        <li class="M-Fact">
If your website includes instructions, a lot of people learn by watching videos, so a short one is always great. (Like the one above!)
</li>
        <li class="M-Fact">

You can use embed to put videos, animations, and even websites on your site.
</li>
        <li class="M-Fact">
        
Create different types of text, subtitles, and headings, not just one straight font, with all of the same font size.
</li>

        <li class="M-Fact"> Use words like 'you' so your audience feels like you are talking to them. In addition, make the site more personable.
</li>
<li class="M-Fact"> 
If you are trying to get clients, use a bio, so they can get to know your personality, along with an about page which should be included on every website (unless you are trying to be anonymous).
</li>
<li class="M-Fact"> 
Do deep research to try and find information that is not included elsewhere, especially if you are trying to teach something to someone, or create a product that is not similar to anything in its field.
</li>
<li class="M-Fact">
Use colorful photos that aren’t straight from shutterstock. People like to see something of you, and not something of someone else that is a little bit different than what your business is. 
</li>
<li class="M-Fact">Include your brand a lot, whether it is a logo or your company name, or a watermark if you have an online service.
</li>
<li class="M-Fact">Finally, keep it simple, with more detail as the reader clicks further onto your page. Don't forget to have a creative touch!
</li>
        </ul>
         
   


      
		<h3 id="buying" class="Header">Where Should I Buy and Host a Website?</h3>	
		<p class="M-Fact">Google domains is a great way to get a website, for under 20 dollars per year. Github repositories also can give you a free web hosting service, however, if your website is extremely javascript oriented, this might not be the best way for you. But, if you have a simple website to teach something or a publication website with a few ads, this may work out. Then there is GoDaddy and others for a slightly higher price, but those can help you make your website as amazing as possible for your customers and/or your readers. On the other hand, if you are planning to program your entire website from scratch, Bluehost is a great web hosting company. Starting at around $3 a month, you can get a WordPress builder, and over 300 design templates. It can also include a free domain for your first year, with decent customer support 24/7. Their domains cost around 10-20 dollars, however, you will have to pay an additional fee for privacy and protection. You can opt out of this. If your website is for a larger store, or company, the last option will fit your needs a little bit better. There is also always Shopify which can range from $30-300 dollars a month, with a 14-day free trial.
